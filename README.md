### Webdeveloper👩‍💻 with a women and human rights backround

- I am especially interested in protection mechanism against digital violence 🙅‍♀️ and IT-security.
- 🌱 Currently I am working with co-students on a webside to reduce and track your carbon footprint.🦶
- 👯 Looking to collaborate on open source projects with a positive social impact.
- Still have to learn a lot (of course)🤯, so I’m looking for help with all my coding related questions.🙋‍♀️
